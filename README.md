Dotfiles
========

My ugly dotfiles and scripts. Some of the scripts shamelessly copied from elsewhere -- credit where credit is due.

The idea is to divide the repo using branches -- each OS setup has it's own branch. Files are restored/backed up using GNU stow.

* `master` is my goto Arch laptop. 
* `macos` is my work MBP
* `server` is a my home server
* `vm` is my VM config

TODO
====

- [ ] fzf/fzy for zsh
- [ ] repl for nvim
- [ ] markdown/language processors/gui for nvim: for note taking replacement
- [ ] reduce vimrc to single .vimrc without plugins(just for bootstrapping)
